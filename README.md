# Prerequisites.
- Python

# How to use.
1. Download the file.
2. Copy/move the python file (the one ending in .py) to your desired folder where you need to modify the files.
3. After that, open up a terminal window or cmd window in that folder.
4. Paste ```python3 addon_to_linux_v1.4.4.py``` in that terminal window/cmd window and hit enter.

# Troubleshooting.
- Q. Why does it give a unicode error?
- A. First, go to the file which gives you the error, after that look for any weird characters or lines starting with ```#```. After that, delete that line of code and rerun the script.
